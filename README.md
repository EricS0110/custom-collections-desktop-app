# Custom-Collections-Desktop-App
This repo serves as the desktop client for the Collection Management project.  It is written in Python and uses the
CustomTkinter library for the GUI elements.  The app is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use interface for managing
collections of items.  A user can create, edit, and delete collections and items within those collections.  The app also
supports exporting and importing collections to and from Excel files.

Learn how to set up the project and run the app by following the instructions
[linked here](https://erics0110.github.io/custom-collections-desktop-app/).

Once you have the app working and data available in MongoDB, you can also optionally set up the Android app to be able
to view the data on your phone.  Instructions for setting up the Android app can be found
[here](https://github.com/EricS0110/show-me-what-i-got/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).
