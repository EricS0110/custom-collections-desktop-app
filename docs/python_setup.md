# Getting Set Up with Python

This section will walk you through setting up a Python environment from scratch.  If you already have Python 
installed and a virtual environment set up that this application can use, you can skip this section!

## Downloading and Installing Python

This was supposed to be as easy as running a Windows batch file I set up to run the commands to download and install
Python 3.13 for you if it wasn't found on your system, but Microsoft Defender is too good at its job and will block any
such scripts from running if they were downloaded from the internet.  Hopefully these instructions are clear enough, 
but if not please leave an Issue with your hang-ups on the GitHub repo, and I'll try my best to keep the documentation
updated!

1. To get started, navigate to [this link](https://www.python.org/) to download Python.  Please look
for the latest version of the 3.13 version of Python.

2. Once the installer file finishes downloading, you'll want to run it.  You can do this by double-clicking the file in
your downloads folder, or by clicking the file in your browser if it's still in your downloads bar.
